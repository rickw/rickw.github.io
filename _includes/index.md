I am an experienced developer and architect living in New York City. I have over 20 years experience in a wide variety of technologies and I am passionate about simple solutions to complex problems.

I have done projects ranging from simple network setup to large scale high availability n-Tier systems such as the iO Digital Cable project for Cablevision of Long Island. I favor development but enjoy all aspects of the industry. I use Agile development methodologies and Scrum for my projects.

I have worked on small eCommerce applications in Ruby on Rails and Telephony applications using Asterisk implemented on Amazon EC2. Most recently I've worked on several iOS applications for iPhone and iPad.

Currently I am working on a CoreText based eBook reader for the iPad. Recently I've worked on a popular eBook reader, a financial news reader application, and a home energy savings application.

I am seeking contracts with any of those technologies or other technologies I have experience in. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have about my practice, availability or anything else interesting.

### Abstract

I am an experienced software developer and architect with over twenty years’ experience, and I am passionate about simple solutions to complex problems. I have been involved for the past five years in the mobile app arena, in both native app development and the backend support stack. Some of the major projects that I have played an integral part in are: HBO Go (worked on research for a new generation of app, fixed bugs involving OpenGL effects and other bugs, assisted the team); TrialGuides (designed and built a CoreText based eBook layout engine and reader using GCD async arhitecture, implimented custom attributes for objects not available in iOS); Nook for iOS (designed and wrote an Objective-C wrapper around the Adobe RMSDK using NSOperationQueues, wrote the paging model and developed UIKit based text selection); HEAT Home Energy Audit Pro (built an Objective-C wrapper and Unit Tests for building a Windows DLL into an iOS app).

Before mobile applications, I was the infrastructure architect for the iO digital cable project at Cablevision. I am also active in the OpenSource community, particularly in Swift development. I have a new blog SwiftTi.me where I and other coders are sharing our experiences with this new language. My current Swift Time project is a Swift Reachability class I call “SwiftlyReachable.”
